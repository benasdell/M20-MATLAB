# M20-MATLAB
This repository contains all of the project code written for my C&EE M20 - Introduction to MATLAB course that I took in Fall 2019 at UCLA. Attached to each subfolder is also the Latex report I wrote for each assignment.
Using this code to complete any assignment in a future M20 course at UCLA is a violation of the academic integrity policy.
